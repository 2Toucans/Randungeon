# Randungeon
Assignment 2 for COMP7051

Q for noclip
WASD or arrow keys for movement
Left Shift for moving down in noclip
Space for jumping and moving up in noclip
Home resets the player
Z resets the maze and the player and deletes save file
T toggles day/night
F toggles fog
P saves file

Commands for Pong:
Nighttime - darkens sky
Gottagofast - speeds up ball

This version has the day/night and fog working
It was a one-line fix, most of the code was still there but it just wasn't enabled
You can confirm this if you like by checking the movement testing room in V1, where one block has the
shader with fog + ambient lighting (day/night)
